# HCGrades

HCGrades is a SwiftUI app built to allow Hinsdale Central HS students view their grades easily on their iOS devices   
as well as calculate grades needed on final exams. 

It uses an internal browswer and Javascript to retrieve HTML content, and a Swift wrapper of BeatifulSoup is then used to parse their information.
